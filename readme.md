Simple Ballistics Calculator

This is just that, it's a very simple ballistics callculator I created baised upon the GNU Ballistics Libaray. 

I use to print out range cards etc... It's really very simple you can enter ballistic variables, then view / print out range cards. 

It's FREE and open souce.
